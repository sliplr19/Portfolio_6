This project I have to get done quickly because it's time sensitive: it's a March Madness predictor code! The first game is Thursday, so I'll need to get my predictions together before then. We have a lot of datafiles to go through and then I'll try to cobble them together in a way that makes sense to me (and maybe no one else). 

```{r packages_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
power_rankings <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Owner\\Documents\\Portfolio_6\\Portfolio_6\\data\\power_rankings.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
rpi <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Owner\\Documents\\Portfolio_6\\Portfolio_6\\data\\rpi.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
wab <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Owner\\Documents\\Portfolio_6\\Portfolio_6\\data\\wab.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
